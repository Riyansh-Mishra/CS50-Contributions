# CS50-Contributions
This repository contains solutions for the problem sets and projects offered by the CS50x course from Harvard University.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Each program demonstrates a specific programming concept or algorithm implemented in C.

credit.c â€“ Validates credit card numbers using a particular algorithm.

readability.c â€“ Calculates the reading grade level of a text using the Colemanâ€“Liau index.

scrabble.c â€“ Computes scores for a two-player Scrabble-style word game.

runoff.c â€“ Implements a ranked-choice (runoff) voting simulation.

substitution.c â€“ Performs text encryption using a substitution cipher.

mario.c â€“ Prints a double-pyramid structure reminiscent of Super Mario Bros.

ðŸ§© Technical Details

All programs are written in C and emphasize key computer science principles such as:

Control structures (loops, conditionals)

Data types and arrays

String manipulation

Algorithms and logic design

File input and output

ðŸš€ Purpose

This repository serves as a reference and practice environment for improving C programming proficiency, algorithmic thinking, and clean coding practices.
